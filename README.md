### I was inspired to create this project by the advice of my colleagues and the lack of a regulated DC voltage and DC power supply. I also wanted to practice PCB design. I used Eagle CAD for this. The project is based on one of the schematics in The Art of Circuitry by Paul Horowitz and Hill Winfield. There are many variants of this device on the network, but it seems to me that it is simpler and does not require many components. Of course, this scheme has a number of positive changes compared to the original. Everything you need to make a board and assemble a device is in the repository.I am sure that even a novice radio amateur will be able to assemble it, and if something suddenly does not work out, then write to the email address: daineko.a32@mail.ru.    P.S. All goodness and fresh cookies!
